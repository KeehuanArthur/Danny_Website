Korean Fire
I have seen many illustrations playing with English typography, so I decided to design an illustration playing around with typography for another language. The language I used is Korean; I took the word fire, and played with the characters to not only make the word easy to understand at first glance but avoid making the word less readable to those who understand Korean.
