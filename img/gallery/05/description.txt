Mayo Surfboards
I was assigned to redesign the logo for the company Mayo Surfboards. I researched themes that can help with the design and created different thumbnails that I believe would work as a logo. The final left logo is the final result of every iteration the log underwent. Additionally, I incorporated the logo into products such as business cards and t-shirts to give an idea on how it would look on merchandise.
